<h3>Course Description &amp; Goals</h3>
<p>Social media is now a ubiquitous part of everyday life. People are routinely using social media to communicate with friends and family, follow the latest news, and to participate in politics. As a consequence, researchers have been increasingly interested in understanding the use, nature and effects of social media in everyday life. The scholarly interest on social media use gives rise to a need to think carefully about ethical considerations and methods for studying these channels, as well as the limitations of this type of research.<br />
This workshop focuses on social media research methods and overviews a variety of computational methods for collecting and analyzing data from social media platforms. It also discusses the implications and limitations – both technical and ethical – of conducting research on social media. The workshop will cover both the theoretical foundations of social media research and the practical skills for collecting and analyzing data.</p>
<p>This course is meant for any student with an interest in researching human behavior on and around social media platforms, such as Facebook and Twitter. A computer with RStudio installed is required.</p>
